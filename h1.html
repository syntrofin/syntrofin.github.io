        <h1>Hinduism as a Banyan Tree, Story of a Sage</h1>
        <h2>Recognizing Smallness to Vastness — Thanking Old and Striving for New</h2>

    <main>
        <p>One day, a curious traveler wandering through a vast garden grew tired and sat beneath the wide, cooling shade of an enormous Banyan Tree. As he rested, he noticed a Sage and told him he has been travelling from far away lands and explain Hinduism in a visual way.</p>
        <p>The Sage smiled and replied that this single tree held a strange and wonderful truth.</p>
        <!-- Image placeholder <iimg2> -->
        <p>He invited the traveler to observe closely. The Banyan Tree had no single visible beginning and no clear end. From its branches, finger-like roots descended from the sky, embracing the earth. Once they touched the soil, they transformed into strong new trunks. The tree was always ancient because of its deep roots, yet always new because of these ever-forming pillars.</p>
        <p>“This,” the Sage said, “is how Hinduism lives.”</p>

        <h3>What many call “one God” is, in Hindu thought, the Ultimate Reality — infinite, uncountable, and beyond numbers. One or two are human inventions; the infinite cannot be measured.</h3>

        <p>The **Vedas** are the tree’s earliest seed — emerging not as rigid commandments, but as revelations that gave rise to everything that followed. Like spores that no longer need to be seen once the tree has fully grown, their essence lives on throughout the whole.</p>

        <h3>Humanized expressions of cosmic stories are Devas — often translated as “gods,” though imperfectly — are the tree’s main stem.</h3>
        <p>They are humanized expressions of cosmic principles, nature, memory, and history, blended with heroic narratives to make the abstract understandable.</p>

        <h3>Ever-evolving guides for human conduct are the branches.</h3>
        <p>They grow, bend, and adapt with time, culture, and circumstance.</p>

        <h3>Varying and the countless temples are the Banyan’s prop roots</h3>
        <p>— touching the ground in many places, offering support and access from every direction.</p>

        <h3>Near symbolic actions performed in temples and homes — rituals, gestures, chants — are its leaves, quietly sustaining life.</h3>

        <h3>Six schools of philosophy are the fruit, containing hidden flowers within — logic, inquiry, and reflection — feeding those who seek understanding.</h3>

        <p>The Sage then spoke of the known and unknown forces of reality:</p>
        <!-- Image placeholder <iimg4> -->

        <ul>
            <li>**Vishnu** represents preservation — the ongoing balance that keeps the tree alive.</li>
            <li>**Shiva** represents transformation — stillness and change, destruction and renewal.</li>
            <li>**Shakti** represents energy and nature — the subtle power that makes growth possible.</li>
            <li>**Brahma**, the creator of the visible world, represents secondary creation. Creation is blessed and essential, yet traditionally less emphasized in worship than preservation and transformation.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Image placeholder <iimg5> -->

        <p>When the tree requires correction, Vishnu sends **Avatars**. When stability is needed, Shiva stands as countless pillars. When vitality is required, Shakti expresses herself in many forms.</p>

        <p>The many deities worshipped are like the tree’s prop roots — distinct, accessible, and deeply connected to these greater principles.</p>

        <p>The curious traveller now know with Sage’s conclusion of the Banyan tree perfect illustration—Hinduism is **Recognizing Smallness to Vastness**. The abstract forces of First Cause, Preservation, Transformation, and Energy take on thousands of visible forms to support the tree — and the life within it.</p>

        <p>And Hindus, he said, are like the birds who live in its branches: small sparrows and strong hawks alike. They read the stories, perform rituals, visit temples, question, doubt, believe, and belong — each in their own way — resting within the same vast tree. Hindus Live **Thanking Old and Striving for New**.</p>
