<h1>How would you compare ⸻ Clean, enterprise-standard stack of all phases (expand discovery and others where possible)with construction of a home starting from acquiring land, titles, survey, leveling, foundations, stick building, walls and roof, county certification, inspection, and interior&nbsp;</h1>
This is a very strong analogy, and it maps cleanly to how executives intuitively understand complex enterprise programs.&nbsp;
I’ll do this in three layers:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Clean enterprise-standard phase stack&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; One-to-one home construction mapping&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Why this analogy works (and where it breaks)&nbsp;
No fluff.&nbsp;
<h2>Clean, enterprise-standard stack (Revenue Lifecycle / Enterprise Platform)&nbsp;</h2>
This is a widely accepted phase model in large programs (consulting + EA language).&nbsp;
Phase stack (top-down, neutral)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Vision & Intent&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Discovery&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Design&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Build&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Validate&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Deploy&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Operate & Evolve&nbsp;
Now expand Discovery and the adjacent phases, since that’s where confusion usually lives.&nbsp;
Expanded phases (with precision)&nbsp;
<h3>Vision & Intent&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Business goals&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Revenue model intent&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Guardrails (regulatory, financial, risk)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Success measures&nbsp;
Why are we building this at all?&nbsp;
<h3>Discovery (most misunderstood phase)&nbsp;</h3>
Discovery is fact-finding and constraint identification, not solutioning.&nbsp;
Includes:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Business process reality (not slides)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Contract types & pricing behaviors&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Revenue recognition rules&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Legal & compliance constraints&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Data truth (what exists vs what’s trusted)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Org & operating model realities&nbsp;
Deliverable:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Discovery Framework / Baseline&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Known unknowns surfaced&nbsp;
What is actually true today?&nbsp;
<h3>Design&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Target operating model&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Process orchestration&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; System responsibilities (CRM / CPQ / Billing / ERP)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Integration patterns&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Data ownership&nbsp;
Deliverable:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Target Architecture&nbsp;
How should it work?&nbsp;
<h3>Build&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Configuration&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Customization&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Integrations&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Data models&nbsp;
Make it real.&nbsp;
<h3>Validate&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; SIT / UAT&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Revenue & accounting validation&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Edge-case testing&nbsp;
Does it work under stress?&nbsp;
<h3>Deploy&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Cutover&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Data migration&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Training&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Go-live&nbsp;
Put people in it.&nbsp;
<h3>Operate & Evolve&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Monitoring&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Enhancements&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Regulatory changes&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Scale & optimization&nbsp;
Live in it.&nbsp;
<h2>Home construction analogy (clean one-to-one mapping)&nbsp;</h2>
Enterprise Phase&nbsp;
Vision & Intent&nbsp;
Discovery&nbsp;
Design&nbsp;
Build (Foundation)&nbsp;
Build (Structure)&nbsp;
Validate&nbsp;
Deploy&nbsp;
Operate & Evolve&nbsp;
<h2>Expanding Discovery using your construction steps (this is the key insight)&nbsp;</h2>
Your analogy is strongest here.&nbsp;
Discovery ≠ “requirements workshop”&nbsp;
Discovery = legal, physical, and regulatory truth.&nbsp;
Construction Discovery includes:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Land ownership & title validity&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Zoning rules (what is allowed)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Survey boundaries&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Soil bearing capacity&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Environmental restrictions&nbsp;
None of these:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Pour concrete&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Choose paint&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Build walls&nbsp;
Yet everything fails without them.&nbsp;
Exact enterprise parallel:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Contract legality&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Revenue recognition rules&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Tax & compliance&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Data truth&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Integration constraints&nbsp;
Skipping discovery is like:&nbsp;
Building a house before checking if the land is yours.&nbsp;
<h2>Why executives instantly get this analogy&nbsp;</h2>
Because:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; You cannot fix land title issues after building&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; You cannot change soil strength with better interiors&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; You cannot “Agile” your way out of zoning laws&nbsp;
Same in enterprise platforms:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; You can’t patch wrong revenue logic later&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; You can’t “refactor” regulatory non-compliance&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; You can’t sprint around broken data truth&nbsp;
<h2>Where the analogy must be used carefully&nbsp;</h2>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Software can evolve faster than buildings&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Architecture allows phased delivery&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; But foundational truths still don’t move&nbsp;
So the correct executive framing is:&nbsp;
Software is flexible — foundations are not.&nbsp;
<h2>Executive-grade summary (use this verbatim if you want)&nbsp;</h2>
Enterprise platform programs follow the same logic as building a home.&nbsp;
Discovery is not designing or building — it is verifying land, title, zoning, and soil.&nbsp;
If discovery is wrong or skipped, everything built on top is at risk, no matter how well executed.&nbsp;
If you want next, I can:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Turn this into a 1-slide executive visual&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Tighten it into a 30-second interview answer&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Align it explicitly to Salesforce Revenue Lifecycle programs&nbsp;
Just tell me the context.&nbsp;
<h1>Deciding what sales models to include in the salesforce RLM project part of discovery&nbsp;</h1>
Yes — deciding which sales models to include is absolutely part of Discovery in a Salesforce Revenue Lifecycle (RLM) program.&nbsp;
But there’s an important precision to add:&nbsp;
In Discovery, you identify and classify sales models.&nbsp;
You do not design or optimize them yet.&nbsp;
Let me frame this cleanly so it holds up in exec rooms and interviews.&nbsp;
<h2>Where this sits in the RLM phase stack&nbsp;</h2>
Discovery answers what exists and what must be supported.&nbsp;
Design answers how each model will be implemented.&nbsp;
So:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; ❌ “Let’s redesign sales motion” → Not Discovery&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; ✅ “These sales motions exist and must be supported” → Discovery&nbsp;
<h2>What “sales model” means in RLM Discovery&nbsp;</h2>
A sales model is defined by:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; How demand is created&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; How price is constructed&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; How orders are placed&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; How revenue is recognized&nbsp;
Not by org charts.&nbsp;
<h2>Examples of sales models you identify in Discovery&nbsp;</h2>
During Discovery, you explicitly surface questions like:&nbsp;
<h3>Who sells and how&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Direct sales&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Inside sales&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Partner / reseller&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Self-service / digital&nbsp;
<h3>How pricing is constructed&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; List → discount&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Contracted pricing&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Usage-based pricing&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Tiered / volume pricing&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Bundle-based pricing&nbsp;
<h3>How customers buy&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; One-time purchase&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Subscription&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Usage / consumption&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Hybrid (subscription + usage)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Amendment-heavy vs straight-through&nbsp;
<h3>How revenue is recognized&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Point-in-time&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Over-time&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Milestone-based&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Variable consideration&nbsp;
(This is critical in RLM.)&nbsp;
<h3>How fulfillment happens&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Immediate digital delivery&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Physical shipment&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Project-based delivery&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Ongoing service&nbsp;
<h2>Discovery deliverable (important)&nbsp;</h2>
Discovery produces a Sales Model Inventory, not solutions.&nbsp;
Example output:&nbsp;
“The platform must support:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Direct enterprise subscription sales with amendments&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Partner-led resale with net pricing&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Usage-based add-ons billed monthly&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; One-time services recognized on milestones”&nbsp;
No config decisions yet.&nbsp;
<h2>Why this must happen in Discovery (home analogy)&nbsp;</h2>
This is equivalent to:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Deciding whether the land will support:&nbsp;
A single-family home&nbsp;
A duplex&nbsp;
A mixed-use building&nbsp;
You are not drawing the house yet —&nbsp;
you are deciding what kinds of buildings must legally stand on this land.&nbsp;
<h2>What happens if you push this to Design (bad outcome)&nbsp;</h2>
If sales models are discovered late:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; CPQ redesign&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Billing rework&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Revenue recognition corrections&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Contract remediation&nbsp;
This is the #1 cause of RLM program overruns.&nbsp;
<h2>Clean interview-grade statement (you can reuse)&nbsp;</h2>
In Discovery, we identify and classify all sales models that the revenue platform must support — direct, partner, subscription, usage, and hybrid.&nbsp;
We don’t design solutions yet; we establish the commercial and accounting truths the system cannot violate.&nbsp;
<h2>How this maps specifically to Salesforce RLM components&nbsp;</h2>
RLM Component&nbsp;
Salesforce Sales Cloud&nbsp;
CPQ&nbsp;
Billing&nbsp;
Revenue Recognition&nbsp;
ERP&nbsp;
Bottom line&nbsp;
Yes — deciding which sales models are in scope is core Discovery work.&nbsp;
Designing how Salesforce supports them comes later.&nbsp;
If you want, next I can:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Give you a Discovery checklist for sales models&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Help you phrase this for exec pushback (“why are we talking sales now?”)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Map this directly to Salesforce Revenue Cloud vs Billing vs ERP boundaries&nbsp;
Just tell me.&nbsp;
<h1>Okay, vision statement only says dwelling?&nbsp;</h1>
Great question — this gets into discipline of abstraction, and you’re thinking about it correctly.&nbsp;
Short answer&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp;
At the Vision level, the statement should effectively say only “dwelling” — not house type, rooms, materials, or layout.&nbsp;
Anything more is no longer vision; it’s discovery or design leakage.&nbsp;
Why “dwelling” is the right level for Vision&nbsp;
Vision exists to answer intent, not structure.&nbsp;
In the home analogy:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; ❌ “A 4-bedroom house with a garage”&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; ❌ “A duplex with rental unit”&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; ❌ “Wood-frame construction”&nbsp;
✅ “A residential dwelling for a family.”&nbsp;</h3>
That’s it.&nbsp;
<h2>Enterprise / Salesforce RLM parallel&nbsp;</h2>
Vision statement (correct level)&nbsp;
Enable a unified revenue platform that supports the company’s commercial intent and compliant revenue realization.&nbsp;
Notice what’s not mentioned:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; No sales models&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; No Salesforce products&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; No CPQ vs Billing&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; No subscriptions vs usage&nbsp;
Those belong after vision.&nbsp;
<h2>How Vision → Discovery flows cleanly&nbsp;</h2>
Phase&nbsp;
Vision&nbsp;
Discovery&nbsp;
Design&nbsp;
Build&nbsp;
Validate&nbsp;
<h2>Common mistake (and how to explain it)&nbsp;</h2>
Mistake:&nbsp;
People try to encode choices into Vision to feel decisive.&nbsp;
Reality:&nbsp;
That just moves risk earlier without facts.&nbsp;
A strong executive line you can use:&nbsp;
Vision sets intent, not implementation.&nbsp;
If vision defines structure, discovery has already failed.&nbsp;
<h2>One-sentence rule you can remember&nbsp;</h2>
Vision names the category of outcome; Discovery enumerates the valid options within it.&nbsp;
<h2>If you want a tight template&nbsp;</h2>
Vision (one sentence)&nbsp;
Deliver a compliant, scalable revenue platform that supports the company’s commercial operations.&nbsp;
Discovery (next phase)&nbsp;
Identify all sales, pricing, billing, and revenue models the platform must support.&nbsp;
Clean separation. No leakage.&nbsp;
If you want, I can:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Rewrite your actual RLM vision statement at exactly the right abstraction level&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Help you defend this separation in a steering committee discussion&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Turn this into a 1-slide “phase intent” visual&nbsp;
Just say which.&nbsp;
<h1>Vision statement typically set before an it implementation of erp or RLM begins. Who does this&nbsp;</h1>
In a correctly run ERP or Revenue Lifecycle (RLM) program, the Vision is not set by IT — and not by a single person either.&nbsp;
It is owned by the business, with IT / Architecture acting as translators and guardians.&nbsp;
Here’s the clean, enterprise-accurate answer.&nbsp;
<h2>Short, precise answer&nbsp;</h2>
The Vision is set by senior business leadership (ELT/SLT), often initiated by Finance or Revenue leadership, and formalized with Enterprise Architecture and IT.&nbsp;
IT implements.&nbsp;
Architecture translates.&nbsp;
Business owns intent.&nbsp;
<h2>Who actually contributes (reality, not theory)&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Executive Sponsor (required)&nbsp;</h3>
Usually one of:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; CFO (very common for ERP / RLM)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; CRO / Chief Revenue Officer&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; COO&nbsp;
They:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Own why the program exists&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Define success criteria&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Provide authority&nbsp;
Without this role, vision is weak or tactical.&nbsp;
<h3>Business Leadership (co-authors)&nbsp;</h3>
Functional heads from:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Sales&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Finance&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Legal / Compliance&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Operations&nbsp;
They:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; State business pain and goals&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Set guardrails (compliance, risk)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Agree on what “good” looks like&nbsp;
This is where commercial intent comes from.&nbsp;
<h3>Enterprise Architecture / Lead Architect (critical)&nbsp;</h3>
Often invisible but essential.&nbsp;
They:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Keep vision at the right abstraction&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Prevent solution leakage&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Ensure vision is implementable&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Translate business language → system-neutral intent&nbsp;
A good architect will say:&nbsp;
“That’s design, not vision.”&nbsp;
<h3>IT Leadership (contributors, not owners)&nbsp;</h3>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; CIO / IT Director&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Platform owners&nbsp;
They:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Provide feasibility input&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Highlight constraints&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Estimate scale and complexity&nbsp;
They do not define vision.&nbsp;
<h3>Consulting partners (facilitators, not authors)&nbsp;</h3>
Good consultants:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Facilitate workshops&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Ask uncomfortable questions&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Help articulate the vision clearly&nbsp;
Bad consultants:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Insert their product as vision&nbsp;
<h2>Typical (and correct) flow&nbsp;</h2>
Business senses a problem or opportunity&nbsp;
ELT mandates exploration&nbsp;
Vision workshop(s) happen&nbsp;
Vision statement is ratified&nbsp;
Discovery begins&nbsp;
Design, build, deploy follow&nbsp;
<h2>A clean ownership model (you can reuse this)&nbsp;</h2>
Role&nbsp;
ELT Sponsor&nbsp;
Business Leaders&nbsp;
Enterprise Architect&nbsp;
IT&nbsp;
Vendor&nbsp;
<h2>What happens when this goes wrong (very common)&nbsp;</h2>
❌ Vision written by IT&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Tool-centric&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Narrow&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Misses commercial reality&nbsp;
❌ Vision written by vendor&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Product-shaped&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Biased&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Over-promises&nbsp;
❌ Vision written too late&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Discovery becomes chaotic&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Scope keeps changing&nbsp;
<h2>Executive-ready one-liner&nbsp;</h2>
ERP and Revenue platform vision is a business artifact, authored by senior leadership, with architecture ensuring it stays abstract and implementable — IT executes it.&nbsp;
<h2>Tying back to your earlier framing&nbsp;</h2>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Vision → idealistic intent&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Discovery → real-world constraints&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Design → negotiated strategy&nbsp;
Vision must exist before discovery begins — otherwise discovery has no compass.&nbsp;
If you want, I can:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Give you a 1-page Vision template for RLM / ERP&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Help you phrase this for an interview answer&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Show how this differs in mid-market vs enterprise&nbsp;
Just tell me where you’ll use it.&nbsp;
<h1>I understand what you are saying, my question was whether companies work with different kind of consulting to arrive at this vision&nbsp;</h1>
Yes — many companies do work with consultants to arrive at the Vision, but how they do it (and who) matters a lot.&nbsp;
Here’s the accurate, non-idealized reality.&nbsp;
<h2>Short answer (clear and honest)&nbsp;</h2>
Yes. Companies often engage strategy, transformation, or architecture consultants to facilitate and shape the Vision — but the Vision must still be owned and ratified by business leadership.&nbsp;
Consultants help articulate.&nbsp;
They should not own it.&nbsp;
<h2>The types of consulting involved (this is the key)&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Strategy consulting (why-change vision)&nbsp;</h3>
Examples:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; McKinsey, BCG, Bain&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Tier-2 strategy boutiques&nbsp;
They help answer:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Why now?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; What business outcomes matter?&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; How revenue model or operating model should evolve?&nbsp;
This is business vision, not IT vision.&nbsp;
Used when:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Large transformation&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Market or revenue model shift&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; M&A-driven complexity&nbsp;
<h3>Business / Transformation consulting (operating model vision)&nbsp;</h3>
Examples:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, EY&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Transformation boutiques&nbsp;
They help:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Translate strategy into operating intent&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Align Sales, Finance, Ops&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Define guardrails&nbsp;
This is where Revenue Lifecycle Vision often emerges.&nbsp;
<h3>Enterprise Architecture consulting (structure & abstraction)&nbsp;</h3>
Examples:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; EA boutiques&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Senior independent architects&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Internal EA teams with advisors&nbsp;
They:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Keep vision system-neutral&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Prevent tool bias&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Ensure future scalability&nbsp;
This role is often underappreciated but crucial.&nbsp;
<h3>Vendor / platform consulting (should not define vision)&nbsp;</h3>
Examples:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Salesforce SIs&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; ERP vendors&nbsp;
They:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Provide feasibility input&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Share best practices&nbsp;
But when vendors define vision:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; The vision becomes the product&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Scope is distorted&nbsp;
<h2>How this usually plays out in real companies&nbsp;</h2>
Common (good) pattern&nbsp;
Strategy / transformation consultant frames why&nbsp;
Business leaders align on outcomes&nbsp;
EA helps articulate vision cleanly&nbsp;
Vendors are brought in after vision&nbsp;
Very common (problematic) pattern&nbsp;
Vendor brought in early&nbsp;
Vision becomes “implement X cloud”&nbsp;
Discovery is rushed&nbsp;
Rework later&nbsp;
<h2>Why companies still use consultants (even strong ones)&nbsp;</h2>
Because:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Internal leaders lack time&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Neutral facilitation is needed&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Cross-functional alignment is hard&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Someone has to ask uncomfortable questions&nbsp;
Consultants provide structure and air cover.&nbsp;
<h2>A very precise way to say this (interview-grade)&nbsp;</h2>
Companies often use strategy or transformation consultants to facilitate and articulate the Vision for ERP or Revenue Lifecycle programs. However, ownership remains with senior business leadership, with enterprise architecture ensuring the vision stays abstract and system-neutral before vendors are engaged.&nbsp;
<h2>When consultants are most helpful vs harmful&nbsp;</h2>
Consultant type&nbsp;
Strategy&nbsp;
Transformation&nbsp;
EA&nbsp;
Vendor&nbsp;
<h2>Bottom line&nbsp;</h2>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Yes, companies do use consultants to arrive at vision&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Vision is often co-created&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Ownership cannot be outsourced&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Vendor-led vision is the most expensive mistake&nbsp;
If you want next, I can:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Map which consultant type to use at which phase&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Give you a decision tree companies use (or should)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Show how this differs for startup vs enterprise&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Help you frame this diplomatically when vendors push back&nbsp;
Just say.&nbsp;
Map which consultant type to use at which phase&nbsp;
Below is a clean, enterprise-accurate mapping of consultant types to program phases, specifically tuned for ERP / Salesforce RLM–style transformations.&nbsp;
This is how well-run enterprises actually do it (or wish they had).&nbsp;
<h2>Phase-by-phase consultant mapping&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Vision & Intent&nbsp;</h3>
Primary consultants&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Strategy Consulting&nbsp;

Role&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Configure systems&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Build integrations&nbsp;

<h3>Validate&nbsp;</h3>
Primary consultants&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Change Management / Adoption Consulting&nbsp;
Role&nbsp;

<h2>Clean summary table (copy-ready)&nbsp;</h2>
Phase&nbsp;
Vision&nbsp;
Discovery&nbsp;
Design&nbsp;
Build&nbsp;
Validate&nbsp;
Deploy&nbsp;
Operate&nbsp;
<h2>Two golden rules (very important)&nbsp;</h2>
Rule 1&nbsp;
Never let a vendor lead Vision or Discovery.&nbsp;
Rule 2&nbsp;
Never let strategy consultants design systems.&nbsp;
Violating either guarantees rework.&nbsp;
<h2>One-line executive framing&nbsp;</h2>
Different phases require different kinds of consulting; the mistake is assuming one firm can credibly own them all.&nbsp;
<h2>Why this matters (and why you already sense it)&nbsp;</h2>
You’re implicitly describing separation of concerns, but applied to people and incentives.&nbsp;
Just as:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Vision ≠ Design&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Design ≠ Build&nbsp;
Likewise:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Strategy ≠ Vendor&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; EA ≠ SI&nbsp;
If you want next, I can:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Overlay RACI ownership on this&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Show how budget shifts across phases&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Help you explain this diplomatically to an SI pushing upstream&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8227; Map this specifically to Salesforce RLM + SAP&nbsp;
Just tell me.&nbsp;
