	<!-- Approach - Project Questionnaire -->		
<section id="approoach">
<h2>	RLM Project Questionnaire	</h2>	
<p>	To determine the most effective project approach for an enterprise Revenue Lifecycle Management (RLM) implementation, you can use the following diagnostic questions. These are designed to translate the core characteristics and use cases of each strategy into a discovery tool for stakeholders.	</p>	
<h3>	1. Greenfield Implementation	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Does the organization currently lack any formal CPQ or RLM system for this specific business unit?	</li>	
	<li>Would starting from a completely clean slate allow you to fix broken processes rather than just digitizing them?	</li>	
	<li>Is the freedom to design an architecture without legacy constraints a higher priority than preserving old data?	</li>	
	<li>Are you ready to adopt Salesforce "standard" objects and best practices as your primary blueprint?	</li>	
	<li>Is this implementation for a brand-new product line or a company that is entirely replacing its legacy infrastructure?	</li>	
	<li>Can the business support a "big bang" launch where everyone moves to the new automated platform at once?	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	2. Brownfield / Migration Approach	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	  <li>Is it a non-negotiable requirement to migrate years of historical subscription and invoice data into the new system?	</li>	
	<li>Are there existing legacy processes that are working well enough that they must be retained in the new RLM setup?	</li>	
	<li>Does the project success depend on a complex mapping exercise between old data objects and new Salesforce RLM core objects?	</li>	
	<li>Is the risk of a "start from scratch" approach too high due to the volume of active, multi-year contracts?	</li>	
	<li>Are you planning to replace an existing Salesforce CPQ instance while keeping the current customer and asset data intact?	</li>	
	<li>Will the project require a phased migration to ensure live business operations are never disrupted?	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	3. Pilot / Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Approach	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Could we prove the value of RLM by launching it first for a single, representative product or geographic region?	</li>	
	<li>Is there a high level of technical uncertainty regarding how complex rules (like dynamic bundles) will perform?	</li>	
	<li>Do we need to validate the accuracy of automated revenue recognition logic before committing to a full-scale rollout?	</li>	
	<li>Is the organization large enough that a small-scale "test run" is the only way to gain executive buy-in?	</li>	
	<li>Are you specifically looking to test advanced features like usage-based billing or milestone revenue in a controlled environment?	</li>	
	<li>Can we identify a subset of accounts that would benefit from RLM without affecting the entire enterprise?	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	4. Modular / Phased Rollout	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Would it be safer to launch core functionality (Quote-to-Invoice) first and add advanced features like amendments later?	</li>	
	<li>Does the organization have multiple business lines that require a staggered implementation schedule?	</li>	
	<li>Is the primary goal to reduce initial architectural complexity by focusing on the most standard order types first?	</li>	
	<li>Can the business thrive if we delay features like partner channel management or complex usage rating to a second phase?	</li>	
	<li>Are existing processes so deeply embedded that a total simultaneous change would be too disruptive?	</li>	
	<li>Is the IT team's capacity better suited to managing smaller, focused releases over a longer period?	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	5. Agile / Iterative Start	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Does the business require the flexibility to adapt RLM rules as market conditions or pricing strategies change?	</li>	
	<li>Is the stakeholder group prepared to provide continuous feedback through a series of two-week functional increments?	</li>	
	<li>Are the pricing and discount strategies so complex that they are better built and tested in small, iterative sprints?	</li>	
	<li>Is there a need for continuous process refinement based on real-time testing and user feedback?	</li>	
	<li>Can the project support a model where the "final" set of features is allowed to evolve throughout the implementation?	</li>	
	<li>Does the organization prefer delivering small wins frequently rather than waiting for a single major delivery date?	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	6. Integration-First Start	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Is the success of RLM entirely dependent on its ability to talk to a rigid, global ERP system (like SAP or Oracle)?	</li>	
	<li>Should we prioritize the "plumbing"—APIs for usage data and invoice posting—before building the user interface?	</li>	
	<li>Are there massive volumes of metered consumption data that must be seamlessly ingested from external systems?	</li>	
	<li>Does the finance team require a fully automated "Quote-to-Cash" integration before any rep can use the system?	</li>	
	<li>Is RLM being implemented primarily to replace a legacy ERP's front-end quoting and billing functions?	</li>	
	<li>Do we need to map complex integration data fields to Salesforce objects as the very first step of the project?	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	7. Feature-First / High-Impact Start	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Is there one specific "Financial Bottleneck"—like manual billing errors—that needs to be solved immediately?	</li>	
	<li>Can we achieve a high ROI by focusing solely on automating subscription renewals or discount approvals first?	</li>	
	<li>Is the business willing to forgo a full-scale implementation in exchange for a rapid fix for its biggest pain point?	</li>	
	<li>Would implementing just one advanced feature, like dynamic bundles, provide the most immediate competitive advantage?	</li>	
	<li>Is the goal to improve revenue recognition accuracy quickly without overhauling the entire sales process?	</li>	
	<li>Can the project scope be expanded to other RLM areas only after a high-impact "quick win" is demonstrated?	</li>	
	</ul>

<h2>	RLM Project Decision Tree	</h2>	
<p>	To help you and your stakeholders finalize a project approach, here is a visual decision tree and a summary of how these questions guide the strategy selection.	</p>	
<p>	How to Use the Decision Tool	</p>	
<p>	By answering the questions provided previously, you can map the organization's current state to one of these seven distinct paths.	</p>	
<h3>	Path A: The Clean Break (Greenfield)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Total process transformation.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Businesses ready to abandon legacy "baggage" in favor of native Salesforce Core automation.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	Path B: The Bridge (Brownfield / Migration)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Continuity and data preservation.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Enterprises where the value is locked in existing, long-term subscriptions that must stay "live".	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	Path C: The Proof (Pilot / PoC)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Risk mitigation.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Validating complex RLM features like usage-based pricing or dynamic bundles on a small scale before a global launch.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	Path D: The Steady Build (Modular / Phased)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Manageable growth.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Large organizations that need to launch core Quote-to-Invoice functions while adding advanced modules over time.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	Path E: The Evolution (Agile / Iterative)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Flexibility and speed.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Dynamic markets where pricing and product rules must evolve through constant testing and feedback.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	Path F: The Financial Anchor (Integration-First)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Data integrity.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Scenarios where RLM must perfectly synchronize with a rigid ERP (SAP/Oracle) to avoid billing and revenue disputes.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	Path G: The Quick Win (Feature-First / High-Impact)	</h3>	
	<ul>		
	<li>Focus: Immediate ROI.	</li>	
	<li>Best for: Solving a singular, high-cost "Financial Bottleneck," such as manual discounting errors, without an initial full-scale overhaul.	</li>	
	</ul>

<h2>	RLM Project Strategy Scorecard	</h2>	
<p>	Here is a Project Strategy Scorecard designed to help you objectively evaluate which RLM implementation path is the best fit for an enterprise.	</p>	
<h3>	RLM Project Strategy Scorecard	</h3>	
<p>	To use this tool, rate each statement for the enterprise on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).	</p>	
<h3>	Section 1: Legacy & Data Complexity	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Statement 1: Our current processes are so inefficient that we would rather redesign them from scratch than migrate them.	</li>	
	<li>Statement 2: We have a massive volume of historical, active subscriptions that must remain "live" without interruption.	</li>	
	<li>Statement 3: We have multiple, fragmented billing systems from various acquisitions that need to be unified.	</li>	
	</ul>
<h3>	Section 2: Risk & Speed to Value	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Statement 4: We need a "quick win" to solve a specific financial bottleneck (e.g., manual pricing errors) immediately.	</li>	
	<li>Statement 5: The organization is highly risk-averse and requires a small-scale proof before a global rollout.	</li>	
	<li>Statement 6: We need the flexibility to change our pricing rules and product structures frequently based on market feedback.	</li>	
	</ul>
<h3>	Section 3: Technical Ecosystem	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Statement 7: Success is 100% dependent on a perfect, real-time integration with a rigid global ERP (e.g., SAP or Oracle).	</li>	
	<li>Statement 8: We have a high volume of metered usage data that must be ingested before we can even begin quoting.	</li>	
	<li>Statement 9: We prefer launching core functionality (Quote-to-Order) now and adding advanced features (Renewals/Amendments) later.	</li>	
	</ul>
<h3>	Scoring Key & Strategy Recommendation	</h3>	
<p>	Total the scores for the specific clusters below to find the most aligned strategy:	</p>	
<h3>	The "Clean Slate" Path (High Scores in 1 & 9)	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Strategy: Greenfield Implementation or Modular Rollout.	</li>	
	<li>Narrative: Focus on building a "Correct by Design" architecture using native Salesforce Core objects.	</li>	
	</ul>
<h3>	The "Continuity" Path (High Scores in 2 & 3)	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Strategy: Brownfield / Migration Approach.	</li>	
	<li>Narrative: Focus heavily on data mapping and harmonizing "Revenue Languages" across legacy systems.	</li>	
	</ul>
<h3>	The "Validation" Path (High Scores in 5 & 6)	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Strategy: Pilot / PoC or Agile Iterative Start.	</li>	
	<li>Narrative: Focus on mitigating risk by testing complex logic (like dynamic bundles) in a controlled environment first.	</li>	
	</ul>
<h3>	The "Efficiency" Path (High Scores in 4 & 7)	</h3>	
	<ul>
	<li>Strategy: Feature-First or Integration-First.	</li>	
	<li>Narrative: Focus on solving the biggest "Financial Bottleneck" or ERP integration hurdle to achieve immediate ROI.	</li>	
	</ul>
	
<p>	How this guides the Project Lifecycle	</p>	
<p>	Once a strategy is selected, it dictates the RLM Start Considerations:	</p>	
		<ul>
	<li>Greenfield/Modular: Start with standard objects: Quote → Order → Subscription → Invoice.	</li>	
	<li>Brownfield/Integration-First: Start with Data Mapping and API definitions for usage ingestion and ERP posting.	</li>	
	<li>Feature-First/Pilot: Start with the Business Rules Engine (BRE) to configure specific pricing or discount logic for high-impact products.	</li>	
		</ul>

	<!-- Kick Off Checklist -->		
<h2>	RLM Strategy Kickoff Checklists	</h2>	
<p>	To help you move from strategy selection to execution, here are the Project Kickoff Checklists tailored to each specific RLM approach. These are designed to ensure the architecture is "Correct by Design" from the very first day.	</p>	
<h3>	RLM Strategy Kickoff Checklists	</h3>	
<h3>	1. Greenfield & Modular Rollout Checklist	</h3>	
<p>	Focus: Standardization and Future-Proofing	</p>	
	<ul>		
	<li>[ ] Define Core Object Flow: Map out the standard journey from Quote → Order → Subscription → Invoice.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Establish Global Attributes: Identify reusable product attributes (like size, color, or tier) to avoid SKU proliferation.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Standardize Pricing: Set up the Business Rules Engine (BRE) with base pricing and standard discount guardrails.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Revenue Policy Alignment: Document the revenue recognition rules for each product type before starting configuration.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Phasing Plan: Identify which "Advanced" features (e.g., mid-term amendments) will be held for Phase 2.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	2. Brownfield & Migration Checklist	</h3>	
<p>	Focus: Data Integrity and Business Continuity	</p>	
	<ul>		
	<li>[ ] Data Lineage Audit: Catalog every legacy system and "Revenue Language" currently in use.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Harmonization Map: Create a cross-walk between legacy SKUs/Price Books and the new PCM structure.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Historical Asset Ingestion: Define the strategy for migrating active subscriptions as Salesforce Assets.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Parallel Run Strategy: Determine how the new RLM and legacy systems will coexist during the transition period.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Reconciliation Plan: Establish the "Before and After" checks to ensure migrated revenue matches historical records.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	3. Pilot & Agile Iterative Checklist	</h3>	
<p>	Focus: Speed and Feedback Loops	</p>	
	<ul>		
	<li>[ ] Scope Isolation: Select the specific region, product line, or high-complexity rule for the initial sprint.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Success Benchmarks: Define exactly what the Pilot must prove (e.g., "Usage-based rating accuracy of 99.9%").	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Sprint Cadence: Establish a two-week cycle for functional increments and stakeholder reviews.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] User Feedback Loop: Set up a dedicated channel for Pilot users to report logic errors in real-time.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Scaling Roadmap: Document the criteria for when a feature is "ready" to move from Pilot to Global.	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	4. Integration-First & Feature-First Checklist	</h3>	
<p>	Focus: Technical Stability and Immediate ROI	</p>	
	<ul>		
	<li>[ ] API & Endpoint Mapping: Define the "contract" between RLM and the global ERP for invoice and usage data.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Bottleneck Analysis: Identify the single highest-impact manual step in the current process to solve first.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Middleware Selection: Verify that the integration layer (e.g., MuleSoft) can handle RLM’s "Headless" API requirements.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Data Sync Logic: Determine the frequency (Real-time vs. Batch) for usage ingestion and general ledger posting.	</li>	
	<li>[ ] Exception Handling: Create the business process for when an integration fails (e.g., an invoice doesn't post to the ERP).	</li>	
	</ul>		
<h3>	The "Architectural Sign-off"	</h3>	
<h3>	Regardless of the strategy chosen, every RLM project should pass this final sanity check before building:	</h3>	
	<ul>		
<p>	Can we bill for this? (Finance alignment)	</p>	
<p>	Can we fulfill this? (Operations alignment)	</p>	
<p>	Is it compliant? (Legal/Revenue alignment)	</p>	
	</ul>
