				I remember the day I went to buy my first car. At first, I was just walking around the Honda showroom, imagining myself driving different cars. I kept changing my mind about the color, the seats, and the little extras, and every time I did, the salesperson changed the price on the screen. It didn’t feel serious at all — it was just dreaming.
				<br><br>
				When I saw the Honda CR-V in a beautiful mocha color with all-wheel drive, I was delighted. I really wanted it, but I was tight on budget, so I bargained hard for a deep discount.
				<br><br>
				At one point, the salesperson frowned and said he needed to ask his manager if such a low price was even allowed. I waited while they talked in the back. When he came back smiling and said yes, I felt happy, but I still knew I could walk away if I wanted. Then he showed me the final price clearly and asked if I was okay with it. I said yes — but even then, nothing had really happened yet.
				<br><br>
				Things changed when I signed my name and paid a small amount to book the car. After that, the salesperson excitedly talked about roof racks, upgraded wheels, GPS, scheduled services, and extra per-mile services. I didn’t worry about all the details at the time. The money was being lent directly by Honda, and I knew I would be paying a monthly loan. I would also pay every month for the GPS and services as long as I used them, until I decided to cancel them the next year.
				<br><br>
				Suddenly, the car wasn’t just an idea anymore. Somewhere far away, a factory was getting ready to build it, and a delivery date was planned. A few weeks later, the car arrived exactly as promised.
				<br><br>
				Before I could take it home, I was given some papers to read. They explained how long the warranty would last, what help I could get if something broke, and what rules I had to follow. I signed them, and those rules stayed with me even when the excitement of buying the car was over. Later on, I even changed those papers to add extra protection that was charged based on the miles I drove each month — without buying a new car.
				<br><br>
				The best day was when I finally got the keys. That car was mine. After I brought my CR-V home from the dealership, I received an email saying my car was now available to view online using its VIN number on Honda’s support website, with all its ongoing details. I felt happy seeing my car there, officially mine. I drove it to school, to work, and on long trips. I happily used the GPS everywhere I went. Over time, the car collected scratches, stories, and memories. Once, when I was late paying a bill, some services stopped for a while, even though the car was still sitting in my garage. Years later, I sold the car, and its journey with me came to an end.
				<br><br>
				Every month, I received bills for the car, the services, and the loan. Each time I paid, the story quietly moved forward. And when everything was finally paid, the story of my first car came to a peaceful close.

				I want to tell you a story about how my medicine got to my door so quickly, without me going to CVS. Is is not as easy I moved my prescription from CVS to Amazon which was still a headache.
				<br><br>
				 Once I place my order, it went to a a giant, super-fast machine that picked my my medication perfectly. Amzon told me, this machine was made by a company called ATS. This machine is like a giant LEGO set with 11,000 tiny pieces—wires, sensors, and even tiny screws.  
				<br><br>
				Long time back, making  these machines was very hard. People had to count every single screw by hand in big, messy notebooks called Excel. The guy who come to us to sell had to He had to work with people who pick these parts and take 97 slow steps just to figure out what it would cost to build one for us at Amazon. It was like trying to count every grain of sand on a beach before you could build a sandcastle! 
				<br><br>
				Then, the sales guy and part pickers wanted to use one envlop called JSON, that they exchange, instead of stitting and counting everything. Now suddently all started changing. Sales guy takes a phto copy of this and send to cost masters, who would send him cost and he would tally up. The part guys some time pick new parts never used before, but they mark them such. The sales guys sends the photo copy of this new parts to SCM guys to get estimated cost. With this the sales guys can come to us now quickly on how much it would cost. And he carries the JSON envelop too as FDA guys mandates it.

				I want to tell you a story about how my medicine got to my door so quickly, without me ever having to go to the store. Moving my medicine from the old pharmacy to Amazon was a big headache at first, but once I finally clicked "order," my medicine arrived just two days later.
				<br><br>
				I asked the Amazon delivery guy how they did it, and he told me that a giant, super-fast machine picked my medicine perfectly. This machine was made by a company called ATS. He said the machine is like a giant LEGO set with 11,000 tiny pieces—wires, sensors, and even tiny screws.
				<br><br>
				He told me that a long time ago, making these machines was very hard. People had to count every single screw by hand in big, messy notebooks. The salesperson had to work with the "part pickers" and take 97 slow steps just to figure out what it would cost to build one for the pharmacy. It was like trying to count every grain of sand on a beach before you could build a sandcastle!
				<br><br>
				But then, the salesperson and the part pickers started using a special "Envelope". Instead of sitting and counting everything one by one, the salesperson now takes a "photo" of this envelope and sends it to the Cost Masters. They look at the photo and quickly send back the right price.
				<br><br>
				Sometimes, the part pickers choose new parts that have never been used before. When that happens, the salesperson sends a photo of those new parts to the SCM guys to find out the cost. The machine is smart; it won't let the salesperson finish until the SCM guys find the real price.
				<br><br>
				The salesperson always carries that envelope because the safety guys need to see it. It’s like a "Passport" that proves the machine was built exactly right to keep our medicine safe. Now, when my medicine arrives, I know it’s because that machine used its special envelope to get everything just right.
