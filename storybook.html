				I remember the day I went to buy my first car. At first, I was just walking around the Honda showroom, imagining myself driving different cars. I kept changing my mind about the color, the seats, and the little extras, and every time I did, the salesperson changed the price on the screen. It didn’t feel serious at all — it was just dreaming.
				<br><br>
				When I saw the Honda CR-V in a beautiful mocha color with all-wheel drive, I was delighted. I really wanted it, but I was tight on budget, so I bargained hard for a deep discount.
				<br><br>
				At one point, the salesperson frowned and said he needed to ask his manager if such a low price was even allowed. I waited while they talked in the back. When he came back smiling and said yes, I felt happy, but I still knew I could walk away if I wanted. Then he showed me the final price clearly and asked if I was okay with it. I said yes — but even then, nothing had really happened yet.
				<br><br>
				Things changed when I signed my name and paid a small amount to book the car. After that, the salesperson excitedly talked about roof racks, upgraded wheels, GPS, scheduled services, and extra per-mile services. I didn’t worry about all the details at the time. The money was being lent directly by Honda, and I knew I would be paying a monthly loan. I would also pay every month for the GPS and services as long as I used them, until I decided to cancel them the next year.
				<br><br>
				Suddenly, the car wasn’t just an idea anymore. Somewhere far away, a factory was getting ready to build it, and a delivery date was planned. A few weeks later, the car arrived exactly as promised.
				<br><br>
				Before I could take it home, I was given some papers to read. They explained how long the warranty would last, what help I could get if something broke, and what rules I had to follow. I signed them, and those rules stayed with me even when the excitement of buying the car was over. Later on, I even changed those papers to add extra protection that was charged based on the miles I drove each month — without buying a new car.
				<br><br>
				The best day was when I finally got the keys. That car was mine. After I brought my CR-V home from the dealership, I received an email saying my car was now available to view online using its VIN number on Honda’s support website, with all its ongoing details. I felt happy seeing my car there, officially mine. I drove it to school, to work, and on long trips. I happily used the GPS everywhere I went. Over time, the car collected scratches, stories, and memories. Once, when I was late paying a bill, some services stopped for a while, even though the car was still sitting in my garage. Years later, I sold the car, and its journey with me came to an end.
				<br><br>
				Every month, I received bills for the car, the services, and the loan. Each time I paid, the story quietly moved forward. And when everything was finally paid, the story of my first car came to a peaceful close.
