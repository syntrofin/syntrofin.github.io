<br>NOPE (no purpouse in buit, create your own purpouse, both small and big - like the lady at Amtrak bringing dove chavolates, guy cleaning fridge, or a good project Director like Bill Lash)
<br>Draw Boundaries - Mind is tricky at skidding into infinite zone when comes to self. Draw boundaries of what to do now and later, tweak them as you go
<br>Pull Down - Mind is tricky at bulding walls when it comes to other people. Bring down the walls. Interact with people, animals, places
 <br>One thing - Liked Minds tells you you are never one thing. Extreme love towards some one or some thing will result in hate towards some thing or some one.
    Agreesion towards some one, may create submissiveness towards something- people, addiction or something else. Becuase living beings and organizations are syntropy, not entropy.

    There is no purpouse, you create you own purpose
    <br>Do not protect memories, keep memories, memories are not stones tied to your feet, they are like clouds float you up and move you forward
    <br>Learning needs not be one way like rememebering typs, categories - it can be devided into patterns you can visualize - "This line is by an RLM Technician"
<br>Joy comes down to giving, sharing, and people.   - Joy Global
